# Snake-Game-Arduino

I did a snake game with Arduino. Here I used a joystick for snake's movement. The snake is displayed on a matrix (8 x 8). With every food eaten the snake evolves and increases his dimension. The score and level are showed on a lcd display. The level is updating at every five meals. The game ends if the snake is eating his body and the player loses. The player wins if he scores 150 and the game stops.
