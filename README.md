# Snake-Game-Arduino

I did a snake game with Arduino. Here I used a joystick for snake's movement. The snake is displayed on a matrix (8 x 8). With every food eaten the snake evolves and increases his dimension. The score and level are showed on a lcd display. The level is updating at every 5 meals.
