# Snake-Game-Arduino

SnakeGame-The game was created with following components:
-Arduino Uno
-Breadboard
-Joystick
-Driver MAX7219
-LCD display
-8x8 Led Matrix

I did a snake game with Arduino. Here I used a joystick for snake's movement. The snake and the food are displayed on a matrix (8 x 8), randomly at every new game. With every food eaten the snake evolves and increases his dimension with one. The score and level are showed on a lcd display and are updating at every food eaten. The level is updating at every five meals. The game ends if the snake is eating his body and the player loses. The player wins if he scores 150 and the game stops.
